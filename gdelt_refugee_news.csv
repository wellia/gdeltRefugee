1115163341,"As the war in Ukraine passes its 500th day, a Manitoba staffing agency continues to help refugees find meaningful jobs in our province. The Myrowich Staffing Agency began last year after its founder discovered the valuable job skills that Ukrainian refugees could bring to the table. “It was a game changer,"" said owner Mark Myrowich. ""I’m in rural Manitoba, half my staff now are Ukrainian. Not all of them speak English, but we were able to find some that did and made them leaders of those crews, and then they were able to work in our factories."" Myrowich said the last few years have been difficult in growing his business because there are not enough workers out there. As he began hiring more Ukrainian newcomers, Myrowich realized the many challenges they faced simply by not speaking English. ""And the disconnect was that there were talented and educated people coming, but they were not going into the jobs that they were happy with,"" he said. Myrowich found so many Ukrainians looking for Manitoba jobs in a variety of fields, he decided to start a staffing agency to fill the need. ""We just basically focus in on Manitoba and getting the right people in the right seat for the right company,"" he said. Since it opened last year, the agency has placed more than 150 Ukrainian newcomers with Manitoba employers in areas such as IT, welding, manufacturing, and childcare. It has even placed one person in an executive role. Myrowich has also hired seven newcomers to help run the agency itself. ""I was like 'who am I going to staff the staffing agency with?'"" he said. ""And I needed to have Ukrainian and Russian-speaking staff so I went out and found staff that spoke those languages."" The agency has two websites, one in Ukrainian where applicants can upload their resume to a database and browse current job listings, and the English-language <a href=""https://hireukrainian.ca/"" target=""_blank"">hireukranian.ca</a> where employers can connect with new recruits. The service is free for Ukrainian refugees, however employers are charged by the agency. It also provides translation services for job ads, resumes, email correspondence, and translation during job interviews. Despite the agency's success, Myrowich said he still has many positions to fill across the province. ""We’re looking for a chef for a hotel in The Pas, Manitoba, automotive mechanics in Thompson and Treherne, we've got tire fitters we need in Dauphin, Manitoba, marine mechanic in West Hawk Lake, we're looking for construction equipment operators in Winnipeg Beach (and) Brandon."" Trades people still have to go thorough all provincial certifications and requirements, including the apprenticeship program, if needed. ""If they’ve got the English, then they can challenge the exam and get the certification,"" said Myrowich. He added that technology has helped overcome the language barrier. ""They don’t speak English and I can't tell that they don’t speak English when they text me, that's how good the translation is over text,"" Myrowich said. The province tells CTV News Winnipeg more than 24,000 Ukrainian refugees have come through the Manitoba welcome centre since the war began. ""On a per capita basis, more Ukrainians have sought refuge in Manitoba than in any other province. And based on federal CUAET data, roughly 15 per cent of all arrivals are coming to Manitoba,"" said a provincial spokesperson by email. Myrowich welcomes all newcomers to their new home. ""It's great that we have this program, that we're welcoming these people into our country,"" he said. ""We need them because there's 'for hire' signs everywhere. ""The people coming here are just good, honest people that are trying to make back what they’ve lost because of this stupid war."""
1115710271,"Immigration Minister Sean Fraser confirmed on Tuesday that the federal government has allotted an additional $97 million in funding to the City of Toronto amidst its housing crisis. The emergency allocation of funding comes in response to public outcry over hundreds of African and Afro-Caribbean refugees that have been sleeping on Toronto’s streets for weeks. Asylum seekers had been camping outside of Toronto’s shelter intake office at 128 Peter Street waiting to be assigned housing amidst a chronic lack of funding and resources.  <a href=""https://nowtoronto.com/news/refugees-forced-to-sleep-on-toronto-streets-share-their-experience/""><em>READ MORE: Refugees forced to sleep on Toronto streets share their experiences and messages for the government</em></a> Thanks to community organizers and activists, the refugees were temporarily relocated to Revivaltime Tabernacle church in North York.  But weeks of multi-level quarreling across governments have forced local services to adopt band-aid solutions.  Founder of Paramount Fine Foods Mohammed Fakih, in addition to helping with fundraising, has donated $20,000 of his own money in aid of the grass-roots operation, which is looking to secure shelter, food and basic necessities for the refugees. <p dir=""ltr"" lang=""en"">Dropped off some more hot meals at Peter St to the asylum seekers who have been abandoned by our governments and left to fend for themselves on the streets.

1117038505,"AMMAN — UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on Tuesday will begin a three-day tour to the Middle East meant to emphasise the UK’s growing, mutually beneficial partnerships within the region. The visit, which will include Jordan, Qatar and Kuwait, comes after the UK government’s recent announcement that citizens from Jordan and the Gulf countries will benefit from the UK’s new Electronic Travel Authorisation visa scheme, which will make travel to the UK cheaper and easier for visitors. On his visit to Jordan, scheduled for Thursday, the Foreign Secretary is expected to announce up to £1.5 million to support initiatives for women and girls. The funding will go towards civil society organisations, a statement from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. He will also meet with representatives from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, and the World Food Programme, where he is slated to announce funding of £30 million over three years to provide cash assistance and support to the poorest refugees. The funding is projected to cover refugees’ basic food and living needs — reaching an estimated 70,000 refugees per year, both in camps and host communities. The UK considers all three countries important partners in energy, defence and security. Further, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has placed trade and investment with Gulf countries among his vital priorities for the UK’s economic growth strategy. UK trade with Qatar and Kuwait was worth £18.1 billion last year alone, the statement said.   Cleverly said: “I am delighted to be back in the Middle East. The UK’s mutually beneficial relationships with the Gulf and Jordan continue to thrive. We have a bright future together. “From working together on shared goals like developing stronger trade ties and security, I am proud of how we are collaborating for the benefit of us all. “The UK also remains committed to supporting refugees and host communities, collaborating with our partners to help the most vulnerable in the region.” In his first stop in Qatar, the Foreign Secretary will meet with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. He will then travel to Kuwait to meet Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah, and explore opportunities to strengthen cooperation. In his visit to Jordan, Cleverly is also scheduled to meet with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi.    "

1117574266,"  AMMAN — The average amount of debt among refugees in both camps and host communities in Jordan has increased by 25 per cent over the past year, according to the World Food Programme (WFP)’s Food Security in Numbers report for the first quarter (Q1) of 2023. Amidst the absence of sufficient employment opportunities, refugee households have been increasingly resorting to “unsustainable financial means such as debt and remittances” to meet their essential needs, including housing, healthcare and education, the report stated.  It also showed that food security levels remained stable among refugees in camps, and improved among refugees in host communities. In Q1 of 2023, 37 per cent of refugees in host communities were food secure, 61 per cent were moderately food secure and the remaining 2 per cent were severely food insecure. In camps, 44 per cent of refugees in were food secure, 55 per cent were moderately food secure and the remaining 1 per cent were severely food insecure during the same period, according to the report.  However, certain household groups “remain more vulnerable and more likely to resort to coping strategies that negatively impact their long-term capacity to meet essential needs”, such as households headed by women or unemployed individuals, or those including members with a disability, the report stated.  The report further highlighted the importance of continuing to provide assistance for the welfare of beneficiaries, as assistance accounts for 20 per cent of the monthly income of out-of-camp refugee households, and 57 per cent of the monthly income of in-camp refugee households. WFP reduced the level of assistance provided to all refugees living in communities from September to November 2022 due to financial constraints. The report observed that this step has lead to “a spike in severe food insecurity among the most vulnerable refugees”. “While work opportunities have been observed to contribute to better food security, refugees still face the bottleneck of finding sustainable, longer-term jobs,” it stated.  According to the report, 55 per cent of refugee adult refugees in the host communities and 70 per cent of adult refugees in the camps remain unemployed in Q1 of 2023. It stressed the importance of “building self-reliance pathways” to help refugees reach economic self-sufficiency and increase their resilience to shocks.  "
1118047948,"SIDON, Lebanon — At least six people were killed on Sunday in clashes in south Lebanon’s restive Ain Al Helweh Palestinian refugee camp, said Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas’s Fateh movement and a source at the camp. The fighting between Fatah and Islamists in the camp, which erupted overnight, killed a Fateh military leader and four of his colleagues, the secularist movement said. A Palestinian source inside the camp, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an “Islamist from the Al Shabab Al Muslim group” was also killed and six others including the group’s leader were wounded. An AFP journalist said clashes at Ain Al Helweh, the largest of the 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, were still ongoing on Sunday afternoon. Fateh in a statement confirmed the death of commander Ashraf Al Armouchi and four of his “comrades” during a “heinous operation”. The statement denounced an “abominable and cowardly crime” aimed at undermining the “security and stability” of the Palestinian camps in Lebanon. A Lebanese soldier was also wounded, hit by shrapnel from “a mortar shell that fell in one of the military posts”, the army said on Twitter, which is being rebranded as X. His condition was reported as stable. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in a statement called the timing of the clashes “suspicious in the current regional and international context”. Mikati criticised “repeated attempts to use Lebanon” as a battleground for the settling of outside scores “at the expense of Lebanon and the Lebanese”. “We urge the Palestinian leadership to cooperate with the army to control the security situation and deliver to the Lebanese authorities those who compromise it,” his statement added. A ceasefire was agreed from 6:00 pm (15:00 GMT) during a meeting of Palestinian factions including Fateh, also attended by members of the Lebanese Amal and Hizbollah movements, a joint statement afterwards said. An AFP journalist reported that the sound of gunfire lessened in the evening. Fighting between rival groups is common in Ain Al Helweh, which is home to more than 54,000 registered Palestinian refugees who have been joined in recent years by thousands of Palestinians fleeing the conflict in Syria. By long-standing convention, the Lebanese army does not enter Palestinian refugee camps in the country, leaving the factions themselves to handle security. The camp has gained notoriety as a refuge for extremists and fugitives. More than 450,000 Palestinians in Lebanon are registered with UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Most live in one of the 12 official refugee camps, often in squalid conditions, and face a variety of legal restrictions, including on employment.  "
1118238843,"AMMAN — Japan’s Ambassador to Jordan Okuyama Jiro visited a Syrian refugee family and a community centre in Irbid Governorate to observe the activities of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) aimed at Syrian refugees.  The Japanese government has allocated $2.5 million to UNHCR between January and December 2023 for the “Protection Assistance to Refugees, Focusing on Community Mobilisation, Women Empowerment and Basic Needs Assistance” project, which provides basic needs of vulnerable Syrian refuges, who suffer from rising food and fuel prices, according to a Japanese embassy statement released on Monday.

The assistance from the Japanese government benefits over 23,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan, the statement said. Okuyama was briefed by Dominik Bartsch, Representative of the UNHCR Jordan Office, about the recent developments in Syrian refugee assistance. In addition to visiting a Syrian family that benefits from UNHCR cash assistance, the ambassador also toured the Princess Basma Centre, which provides support for women’s empowerment and gender equality."
